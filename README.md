# Cultural-Bias-Detection-in-Language-Models
This project focuses on analyzing the crows_pairs_anonymized.csv dataset, which is designed to test binary bias (stereotypical vs. anti-stereotypical). The analysis will explore bias types, compare sentences, and evaluate trends to understand cultural biases in language models.

Objective: To evaluate and quantify biases in language models using the CrowS-Pairs dataset, focusing on how these models handle stereotypical and non-stereotypical sentences across various social bias categories
